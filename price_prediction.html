            <p>Understanding Uber Pricing and Availability

                This graph visualizes the average cost of different Uber vehicle options alongside the number of drivers typically available for each option.
                
                Cost Comparison
                
                Ridesharing with UberPool appears to be the most budget-friendly choice, averaging around $20. This makes sense, considering UberPool combines multiple passengers heading in the same direction.
                On the other hand, if you're looking for a luxurious ride, Black SUV and Lux come at a premium, costing around $80 per trip.
                Availability
                
                The graph indicates that UberX has the most readily available drivers, followed by UberPool. This suggests that you might hail an UberX ride faster.
                It's important to note that taxi availability appears to be significantly lower compared to Uber options in this data set.
                Remember:
                
                Uber prices and driver availability can vary depending on your location, time of day, and demand.</p>

            <h3>On the Basis of Weather</h3>
            <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/mkHxZ3Mv/Screenshot-2024-05-08-214239.png" alt="weather">
            <p>This graph displays the distribution of prices for different weather conditions. The horizontal axis represents the price range, while the vertical axis shows various weather scenarios such as "partly-cloudy-night," "rain," "fog," "clear-day," "partly-cloudy-day," "cloudy," and "clear-night."
                Each weather condition is represented by a colored horizontal bar, with the length of the bar indicating the range of prices associated with that condition. The dots scattered along the bars suggest individual data points or occurrences of prices within that range.
                For example, the blue bar for "partly-cloudy-night" extends from around 20 to 60 on the price scale, indicating that prices under this weather condition typically fall within this range. Similarly, the orange bar for "rain" shows a range from approximately 20 to 70, with a few scattered data points beyond 70.
                The graph allows for a visual comparison of the price distributions across different weather scenarios, potentially aiding in understanding how weather conditions may influence pricing or identifying patterns in pricing data related to weather.</p>

        <div class="location-info">
            <h3>On the Basis of Location</h3>
            <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/XNGXBTgb/Screenshot-2024-05-08-214315.png" alt="location">
            <p>This graph displays surge pricing multipliers for various locations or areas in Boston. The horizontal axis represents the surge multiplier values, ranging from 10 to 20. The vertical axis lists different neighborhoods or districts in Boston.
                Each location is represented by a row of colored dots, with each dot corresponding to a specific surge multiplier value. The color of the dots seems to differentiate the locations, but no legend is provided to explain the color coding.
                For example, the green dots represent the "North Station" area, and the dots extend across the entire range of surge multipliers from 10 to 20, indicating that surge pricing can vary significantly in that area.
                Similarly, the light blue dots represent the "South Station" area, and they also span the full range of surge multipliers.
                The "Financial District" and "Northeastern University" areas, represented by pink dots, appear to have a more concentrated range of surge multipliers, potentially suggesting less variability in surge pricing in those areas.
                This graph allows for a visual comparison of the surge pricing patterns across different locations in Boston, highlighting areas where surge pricing may be more volatile or consistent based on the distribution of dots along the surge multiplier range</p>
